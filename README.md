# Genetic Algorithm Implementation for Mosaic Puzzle

## Mosaic Puzzle
Mosaic puzzle is a variation of the Minesweeper (it is somewhat a reverse Minesweeper). The players start with every clue already uncovered and have to place black cells - the mines - on the grid. The numbers show how many black cells are there in the neighbouring cells (horizontally, vertically and diagonally) including the number cell itself.
